# Increasing the robustness of deep neural networks for text classification by examining adversarial examples
This repository containes code used for my [master thesis 'Increasing the robustness of deep neural networks for text classification by examining adversarial examples'](http://edoc.sub.uni-hamburg.de/informatik/volltexte/2018/238/). Some of the results were also published at the [International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks 2019 (ICANN2019)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-30508-6_54).

## Required python modules
* keras (tested version: 2.1.5)
* tensorflow (tested version: 1.4.0)
* h5py
* numpy
* matplotlib
* gensim (tested version: 2.1.0)
* nltk (tested version: 3.2.5)
* yaml

## Enable TensorFlow in Keras

Edit *~/.keras/keras.json* set:

```
"backend": "tensorflow"
```

Alternatively use enviroment variables:

```
KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
```

## Memory usage
Some of the operations take quite a lot of memory. Usage on 32-bit machines / python or low memory machines is not recomended.
